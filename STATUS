===============

- Started framework for Qualtrics DEEP
- Built out UI for Qualtrics
- Built out IDEEPTime and IDEEPQualtrics core functions
- Added priors
- Added randomization
- Added most of the logic
- Initial testing against current Qualtrics

STILL TODO FOR QUALTRICS:
- Integration of Risk
- JSDoc and in-line documentation
- Refactoring DEEPTime.beginDEEP() first-run
- Validation and error handling
- Warm-up questions
- Consider using lz-string to compress itemRisks and codedIndexers or consider lazy-loading them dynamically
- Separate out DEEPTime and core stuff into another file and use Gulp to combine them when needed
