October 9, 2015
===============

- Started framework for Qualtrics DEEP
- Built out UI for Qualtrics
- Built out IDEEPTime and IDEEPQualtrics core functions
- Added priors
- Added randomization
- Added most of the logic
- Initial testing against current Qualtrics

October 10, 2015
================
- Refactored DEEPTime to DEEPCore; both DEEP Time and DEEP Risk
  will use DEEPCore
- Added selective code switches for DEEP Time and DEEP Risk
- Implemented DEEP Risk
- Documented DEEPCore
- Fixed ID bugs
- Refactored first run

October 11, 2015
================
- Minor refactor of getChoiceOption to make it more compact
- Refactored DEEPCore.nextQuestion and .beginDEEP() and
  renderChoices(), and parts of DEEPQualtrics, to decouple
  the tight connection between DEEPCore and DEEPQualtrics
  by not making DEEPCore call anything on the platform object.
- Added validation/error handling
- Added introduction and warm-up
- Added mode to skip the tutorial

STILL TODO FOR QUALTRICS:
- JSDoc and in-line documentation for DEEPQualtrics
- Check in-line documentation for DEEPCore

CONSIDER:
- Consider using lz-string to compress itemRisks and codedIndexers or consider lazy-loading them dynamically
- Separate out DEEPCore into another file and use Gulp to combine them when needed
