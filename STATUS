October 11, 2015
================
- Minor refactor of getChoiceOption to make it more compact

STILL TODO FOR QUALTRICS:
- JSDoc and in-line documentation for DEEPQualtrics
- Check in-line documentation for DEEPCore
- Validation and error handling
- Warm-up questions

CONSIDER:
- Consider using lz-string to compress itemRisks and codedIndexers or consider lazy-loading them dynamically
- Separate out DEEPCore into another file and use Gulp to combine them when needed
